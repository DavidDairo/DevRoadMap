# Continuous Integration (CI)

## Overview
Continuous Integration (CI) is a DevOps practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository. Automated builds and tests are triggered to ensure new changes integrate smoothly without introducing defects.

---

## Goals of Continuous Integration
1. **Early Bug Detection**: Identify and resolve issues early in the development cycle.
2. **Improved Collaboration**: Encourage frequent code sharing and collaboration among teams.
3. **Faster Feedback**: Provide quick feedback on the quality and functionality of code.
4. **Streamlined Development**: Maintain a consistent codebase and avoid integration hell.

---

## CI Workflow
1. **Code Commit**:
    - Developers push code changes to the shared repository.
2. **Build**:
    - An automated build system compiles the code.
3. **Test**:
    - Automated tests (unit, integration, etc.) validate the changes.
4. **Feedback**:
    - Results of the build and tests are sent to the developers (pass/fail).
5. **Repeat**:
    - The process repeats for every new change to ensure continuous validation.

---

## Key CI Tools
- **Jenkins**:
    - Open-source CI server with customizable pipelines.
- **GitHub Actions**:
    - CI/CD workflows directly integrated with GitHub repositories.
- **CircleCI**:
    - Cloud-based CI/CD solution with parallel testing capabilities.
- **GitLab CI/CD**:
    - Built-in CI/CD functionality in GitLab.
- **Azure DevOps**:
    - CI/CD pipelines with deep integration into Azure.

---

## Benefits of Continuous Integration
- **Improved Code Quality**:
    - Automated testing catches bugs early.
- **Reduced Integration Risk**:
    - Frequent commits ensure smaller, incremental changes.
- **Faster Delivery**:
    - Quicker identification of issues leads to faster development cycles.
- **Stronger Collaboration**:
    - Teams work together more efficiently with shared codebases.

## Example CI Pipeline

Here’s an example CI pipeline using **GitHub Actions**:

```yaml
# Name of the workflow. This is the label that will appear in the GitHub Actions UI.
name: Continuous Integration

# Defines the events that will trigger the workflow.
on:
  push:                # The workflow will run whenever code is pushed to the repository.
    branches:          # The workflow will only run for changes pushed to the specified branches.
      - main           # In this case, the workflow will only run for the 'main' branch.
  pull_request:        # The workflow will also trigger when a pull request is created or updated.
    branches:          # The workflow will run when a pull request targets the specified branches.
      - main           # In this case, the workflow triggers for pull requests targeting the 'main' branch.

# Define the jobs that will run as part of this workflow.
jobs:
  build-and-test:      # The name of the job. It can be anything meaningful, such as 'build-and-test'.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Specifies the environment for the job to run on. This uses the latest Ubuntu runner provided by GitHub.

    steps:              # Steps define the individual tasks that will be executed in the job.
      - name: Checkout code
        # This step checks out the code from the repository into the GitHub Actions runner.
        uses: actions/checkout@v3  # GitHub’s official action to check out code from the repository.

      - name: Set up Node.js
        # This step sets up the Node.js environment for the project.
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3  # GitHub’s official action to install a specific version of Node.js.
        with:
          node-version: '16'       # Specifies the Node.js version (16) to install.

      - name: Install dependencies
        # This step installs the dependencies for the project.
        run: npm install           # Runs the 'npm install' command to install the dependencies defined in package.json.

      - name: Run tests
        # This step runs the test suite of the project to check if everything is working correctly.
        run: npm test              # Runs the 'npm test' command, which executes the project's test script.

```

# Build and Test in CI

In **Continuous Integration (CI)**, **build** and **test** are two critical steps to ensure that the codebase remains stable and functional as developers make frequent changes.

---

## 1. Build

The "build" phase refers to the process of compiling the source code into a runnable or deployable format. It ensures that the code is syntactically correct and that dependencies are properly configured.

### **Key steps in a build process:**
- **Compilation**: Transforming source code into executable code (e.g., `.jar` for Java, `.exe` for C++).
- **Dependency resolution**: Fetching and setting up necessary libraries or frameworks.
- **Packaging**: Bundling files into a deployable format (e.g., Docker images, archives, or binary files).
- **Linting (optional)**: Checking the code for stylistic or syntactic issues.

### **Why it's important in CI:**
- Detects issues like syntax errors or missing dependencies early.
- Produces artifacts that are tested and deployed downstream.

---

## 2. Test

The "test" phase involves running automated tests to verify the correctness and quality of the code.

### **Types of tests commonly executed in CI pipelines:**
- **Unit tests**: Verify individual functions or modules in isolation.
- **Integration tests**: Ensure different components of the application work together correctly.
- **End-to-end (E2E) tests**: Test the entire workflow as a user would interact with the system.
- **Performance tests**: Validate the application's performance under various conditions.

### **Why it's important in CI:**
- Identifies bugs or regressions introduced by new changes.
- Ensures that existing functionality isn’t broken.
- Improves confidence in deploying code to production.

## How Build and Test Work Together in CI

1. **Build First**: The pipeline ensures the code can be compiled successfully.
2. **Run Tests Next**: The compiled code or artifacts from the build step are used for testing.
3. **Fail Fast**: If either the build or test fails, the CI pipeline stops, alerting developers immediately.

---

## Example CI Workflow (Simplified)
1. Developer pushes code to the repository.
2. CI server (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI) triggers the pipeline:
   - **Build Step**: Compiles the code and packages it.
   - **Test Step**: Runs unit and integration tests on the build.
3. If all steps pass, the pipeline marks the build as successful, and the code is ready for deployment.

---

By automating these steps, CI minimizes human errors, reduces integration issues, and speeds up the development lifecycle.
