# üåê HTTP Request & Response Structure

Every HTTP message (from client to server or vice versa) has **3 main parts**:

1. **Start Line**
2. **Headers**
3. **Body** (optional)

---

## üì§ HTTP Request Structure

### ‚úÖ 1. Request Start Line
```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1

	GET ‚Üí HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	/index.html ‚Üí URI (resource being requested)
	‚Ä¢	HTTP/1.1 ‚Üí HTTP version 
```

### ‚úÖ 2. Request Headers
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/html

Headers are key-value pairs that provide **additional information** to the server about the request.

### üì¶ Common Request Headers

| Header           | Example Value                         | Description                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `Host`           | `example.com`                          | Specifies the domain name of the server                 |
| `User-Agent`     | `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64)` | Info about the client making the request                |
| `Accept`         | `text/html, application/json`          | Specifies the media types the client can handle         |
| `Accept-Language`| `en-US,en;q=0.9`                       | Preferred languages for the response                    |
| `Content-Type`   | `application/json`                     | Format of the request body (e.g. JSON, form data)       |
| `Authorization`  | `Bearer eyJhbGci...`                   | Sends authentication credentials (e.g. API tokens)      |
| `Referer`        | `https://example.com/form`             | URL of the page making the request                      |
| `Connection`     | `keep-alive`                           | Controls whether the connection stays open              |
| `Cookie`         | `sessionid=abc123`                     | Sends stored cookies to the server                      |
| `Content-Length` | `123`                                  | Size of the request body in bytes                       |

Host: example.com
User-Agent: CustomApp/1.0
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1...
Content-Length: 58
```


## ‚úÖ 3. Request Body (Optional)

The **request body** is used to send data from the client to the server ‚Äî especially with methods like `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH`.

It usually contains **structured data** such as JSON, XML, or form-encoded data.

---

### üì¶ Common Use Cases

| HTTP Method | Use Case                        | Body Required? |
|-------------|----------------------------------|----------------|
| `GET`       | Retrieve data                    | ‚ùå No           |

Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "blackistan",
  "email": "blacki@example.com",
  "password": "strongpass123"
}
```


## üì§ HTTP Response Structure

The **HTTP response** is what the server sends back to the client after processing the request. Like the request, it has 3 main parts:

1. **Status Line**
2. **Headers**
3. **Body** (optional)

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Response Status Line

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## ‚úÖ 2. HTTP Response Headers

**Response headers** are key-value pairs sent by the server to provide **metadata about the response**. These help the client understand how to handle the returned data.

---

### üì¶ Common Response Headers

| Header             | Example Value                            | Description                                                         |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Content-Type`     | `application/json`                        | Format of the response body (e.g. JSON, HTML, plain text)           |
| `Content-Length`   | `1234`                                    | Size of the response body in bytes                                  |
| `Location`         | `/api/users/42`                           | Used with `201 Created` to indicate the URL of the new resource     |
| `Set-Cookie`       | `sessionid=abc123; HttpOnly`              | Sets a cookie on the client side                                    |
| `Cache-Control`    | `no-cache` / `max-age=3600`               | Defines caching behavior for the client or proxy                    |
| `ETag`             | `"abc123etagvalue"`                       | Unique identifier for a version of a resource (used for caching)    |
| `Expires`          | `Wed, 21 Oct 2025 07:28:00 GMT`           | Tells when the response content should be considered "stale"        |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` | `*`                            | CORS header ‚Äì controls which domains can access the resource        |
| `WWW-Authenticate` | `Bearer realm="Access to the API"`        | Indicates required authentication scheme (e.g., Basic, Bearer)      |
| `Retry-After`      | `120`                                     | Tells client how long to wait before retrying (used with `503`)     |
| `Server`           | `nginx/1.18.0`                            | Info about the server software (can be hidden for security reasons) |

---

### üìù Example Response Header Block

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 256
Cache-Control: no-cache
Set-Cookie: sessionid=xyz123; HttpOnly
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

## ‚úÖ HTTP Response Body

The **response body** is the actual content returned by the server after processing the request.

- It's **optional** (some responses like `204 No Content` don‚Äôt include a body).
- The format is usually defined by the `Content-Type` header.
- It can contain data (like JSON or HTML), error messages, or files.

---

### üì¶ Common Body Content Formats

| Content-Type               | Format Description                     |

| `text/plain`               | Plain text                              |
| `application/xml`          | XML data                                |
| `application/octet-stream`| Binary data (e.g., files)               |
| `image/jpeg`, `image/png`  | Image files                             |

---

### üìù Example JSON Body (for a `201 Created` Response)

```http

Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 42,
  "username": "blackistan",
  "email": "blacki@example.com",
  "created_at": "2025-04-15T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Body Not Always Present

Not all HTTP responses include a body ‚Äî some status codes intentionally return **no content**.

---

#### üì≠ Status Codes Without a Response Body

| Status Code | Name                 | Has Body? | Description                                         |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `204`       | No Content           | ‚ùå No      | The request was successful, but there's nothing to return. |
| `304`       | Not Modified         | ‚ùå No      | Resource has not changed since the last request. Used with caching. |
| `100`       | Continue             | ‚ùå No      | Temporary status to indicate the request should continue. |
| `101`       | Switching Protocols  | ‚ùå No      | Server is switching to a different protocol.        |

---

#### ‚úÖ Other Codes That *May* or *Often* Include a Body

| Status Code | Name                    | Has Body? | Description                                          |
|-------------|-------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `200`       | OK                      | ‚úÖ Yes     | Standard success response with content.              |
| `201`       | Created                 | ‚úÖ Yes     | Includes the newly created resource in the body.     |
| `400`       | Bad Request             | ‚úÖ Yes     | Often includes error messages and validation details.|
| `401`       | Unauthorized            | ‚úÖ Yes     | May contain instructions or messages.                |
| `404`       | Not Found               | ‚úÖ Yes     | Usually includes a message like "Page Not Found."    |
| `500`       | Internal Server Error   | ‚úÖ Yes     | May include diagnostic info or stack trace (not in production). |

---

> üí° Tip: Even if a response **can** include a body, it‚Äôs not always required. The presence of a body depends on the **API or server implementation**.


## HTTP Overview

1.  HTTP 1.0 is **STATELESS** - **Stateless** means that the **server does NOT remember anything** about previous requests made by the same client. 
    Every request is treated as if it's **brand new**, with **no memory of past interactions**.

2. Based on TCP/IP - ## üß± The TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)

HTTP runs on top of the **TCP/IP networking model**, which has 4 layers:

| Layer             | Example Protocols              | Role                                         |
|------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Application**   | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS           | What the user interacts with (web, email)    |
| **Transport**     | TCP, UDP                       | Reliable or fast delivery of data            |
| **Internet**      | IP                             | Routing data across networks (IP addresses)  |
| **Network Access**| Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ARP           | Physical delivery over cables/wireless       |


## üåê HTTP/1.0 Lives at the Application Layer

- **HTTP** is an **Application Layer** protocol.
- It **relies on TCP** (Transport Layer) to deliver data **reliably** between client and server.


3. 3 parts to the request/respsonse message - 

1. **Start Line** ‚Äì Describes the request or response status  
   ‚Üí `GET /home HTTP/1.1` or `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`

2. **Headers** ‚Äì Metadata (e.g. content type, cookies, auth)  
   ‚Üí `Content-Type: application/json`

3. **Body** ‚Äì Optional data (like form inputs or JSON)  
   ‚Üí `{ "username": "blackistan" }`
